            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Braden! Life’s an adventure, and I’m here for all of it—whether it’s diving into the mysteries of space (seriously, I’m a huge space geek), learning something new, or taking on a challenge just to see if I can do it. I graduated from Utah State University with a degree in Data Analytics, but my passions go far beyond numbers—I’m all about fitness, reading great books, and chasing big ideas. One of those ideas was building this website from scratch, and others are linked in my Projects section of this website. Be sure to reach out if you see something that's interesting to you, or if you just want to chat!</p>
